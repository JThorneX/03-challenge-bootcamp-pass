# Password Generator

## Choose among 4 character types to create a randomized password. This generator uses basic javascript and css.

- You must choose at least one category and may not choose less than 8 characters or more than 128.

## How

- This was my third draft, as I had tried several other methods of getting the script to run efficiently through the choices smoothly. I tried arrays but haven't worked with them enough yet to fully make it work, then I tried doing calculations based off of the ASCII chart and quickly realized the way the special characters are split up was simply not worth it to me and was determined to find a simpler solution. I then found the expressions and operators category on MDN and read about addition assignment and decided to go with it.

- Press the button and answer the prompts.
